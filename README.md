# Connect-Four-Neural-Net
Our machine learning models for a game of connect four

We use a three layer neural network to create a model to predict whether the current board is a likely win, draw or loss for player x. The 6 x 7 board has been unrolled into a 42 column vector, with 67,000 training examples.

The accuracy thus far with multi-class classification is 78.6%.
